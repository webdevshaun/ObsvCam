# ObsvCam
## Spectator Cams For Observing Counter-strike Matches
Heres a valve wiki explaining  [here](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/CSGO:_Spectator_Tools#Spectator_Cameras)
### What i've changed :pencil2:
- Added Vertigo To Map Selection
- Added `bind "F8" "slot3; spec_player 8"` as vertigo is added to F8 in each obs_{map}.cfg
- Removed unnecesary crap from addto-observer.cfg
